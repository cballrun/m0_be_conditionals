# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  * I feel confident in my understanding. I was having an issue where I put =! instead of != but this was the only issue I had
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  * I also feel confident with the logical operators. I succeeded on my first try in the spicy challenge which mixed logical operators with an else statement.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  * I feel confident in my understanding and fluency of the if statements.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  * I am not sure on the exact amount of time as I took breaks to walk the dogs, cook dinner, etc. but it definitely took much longer than expected.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I need to practice with longer elsif statements and review the vocabulary and syntax of the statements. I do not need to adjust my calendar to do this.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * How can user inputs be integrated into the variables? I am hoping that we will cover this during this week. I remember doing a little bit with it during Try Coding. I will research it myself if we do not cover it this week.
